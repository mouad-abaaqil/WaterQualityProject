# Water Quality Index Calculation

This project calculates the Water Quality Index (WQI) using Python. It includes detailed data analysis and visualizations to evaluate water quality based on various parameters. This project was developed during my internship at RAMSA, a public organization responsible for water supply and wastewater treatment in Agadir.

## Project Structure

- `Water_Quality_Index_Calculation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for data processing, WQI calculation, and visualizations.
- `Water quality.xlsx`: Dataset containing water quality parameters.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
- `LICENSE`: Project license.
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files.
