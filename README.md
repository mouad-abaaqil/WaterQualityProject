# Water Quality Index Calculation

This project calculates the Water Quality Index (WQI) using Python. It includes detailed data analysis and visualizations to evaluate water quality based on various parameters. This project was developed during my internship at RAMSA, a public organization responsible for water supply and wastewater treatment in Agadir.

## Project Structure

- `Water_Quality_Index_Calculation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for data processing, WQI calculation, and visualizations.
- `Water quality.xlsx`: Dataset containing water quality parameters.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
- `LICENSE`: Project license.
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mouad-abaaqil/WaterQualityProject.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd WaterQualityProject
   
3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Download the dataset**:
   Ensure the `Water quality.xlsx` file is in the project directory. If not, please add it manually.

5. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

6. **Open the notebook**:
   Open `Water_Quality_Index_Calculation.ipynb` in the Jupyter Notebook interface.

## Project Details

This project includes the following key components:

- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Importing libraries and dataset, initial data exploration.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and scaling.
- **WQI Calculation**: Calculating the Water Quality Index based on various parameters.
- **Data Visualization**: Generating visualizations for data distribution, WQI distribution, and geographic WQI representation.
- **Conclusion**: Summarizing results and discussing implications for water quality management.
